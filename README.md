Virtual Notepad:
The "Virtual Notepad" project showcases an innovative approach to digital
drawing and writing using hand gestures. It combines ML, CNN, and computer
vision technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly application.
This project is particularly beneficial for individuals who enjoy drawing
and doodling, offering a digital alternative that eliminates the need for
traditional pen and paper

Image Preprocessing:
Image preprocessing enhances the quality and consistency of images for machine learning models, improving performance and reducing computational complexity. Key techniques include resizing, normalization, augmentation, and noise reduction

linear and logistic regression:
explored linear regression for predicting continuous outcomes and logistic regression for categorical outcomes. Understanding these techniques is crucial for selecting the right model based on the prediction task, enhancing machine learning effectiveness

CNN assigment:
we successfully classified images of four different animals using image preprocessing and machine learning techniques. The model effectively distinguished between the animal classes, demonstrating the power of these methods in image classification tasks. This project highlights the importance of preprocessing and feature extraction in achieving accurate and reliable results

drag and drop:
using finger moments we can move the image on computer screen
